title: Libra - Facebook's next big bet
date: "2019-07"
---

Last month, Facebook finally took the curtain down behind Libra - its new cryptocurrency & blockchain initiative. I've gone through numerous twitter threads, blog posts, and conversations with my family at the dinner table on Libra. The main takeaway is that this is a huge deal that could have massive implications to Facebook, cryptocurrencies, and even the way we interact with money. For this reason, I thought I would provide my main thoughts on Libra:

1. Libra can be incredibly beneficial to both Facebook and its users
2. Libra is great for crypto in general, especially Bitcoin
3. The biggest risks to Libra's success are regulatory, legal, and physical hurdles

## Facebook is betting big on cryptocurrencies

Since Bitcoin's historic rise towards the end of 2017, [several companies](https://gizmodo.com/long-blockchain-maybe-not-as-smart-as-it-thought-1828042681) have taken advantage of "crypto mania", moving into the blockchain space seemingly to solely increase their stock price. The same can't be said for Facebook. Aside from the data privacy scandals that have plagued Facebook's recent past, financially, the company is at the top of its game, with [profits rising each year](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/FB/facebook/gross-profit).

When you're as large as Facebook, you're allowed to make some risky bets, and Facebook's next big bet is on cryptocurrencies. As the below infographic shows, compared to the other tech giants, Facebook's revenue is undifferentiated and relies heavily (98.5% of revenue!!) on its Ad business. Facebook is looking to diversify its revenue stream by taking advantage of its enormous user base ([2.4 billion worldwide](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/)) and adopting them to Libra.

Using cryptocurrency as a foundation, Facebook could become the world's largest bank overnight. With Libra, Facebook can:

- Expand as a marketplace -  Users in developing markets can make purchases with Libra from Facebook or from other companies in the Libra association. Facebook can collect fees from purchases.
- Provide financial services -  Users can apply for things like credit and loans that are issued in Libra. Facebook will be able to provide financial services to people who desperately need them.
- Monetize Whatsapp - The service, which is absolutely [massive in India](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/whatsapp-statistics/) alone (200-300 million users), can become Facebook's version of China's WeChat.
- Collect financial data - Facebook has said that financial data will be separate from a user's Facebook data. Even with this barrier, Facebook can bolster its ad business with this additional treasure trove of data.

These are just a few potential way how Facebook can generate revenue off Libra. It will be interesting to see how Facebook leverages Calibra, its own Libra wallet, that will be built into WhatsApp and the Messenger app. 

## Finally, a use case for cryptocurrencies

Skeptics, including myself at times, agree that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are cool technological achievements, but aren't very useful.

Libra proposes to change that notion by <b>banking the unbanked</b>.

[1.7 billion people worldwide don't have access](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/immersive-story/2018/05/18/gains-in-financial-inclusion-gains-for-a-sustainable-world?cid=ECR_TT_worldbank_EN_EXT) to a bank account. Yet, almost [three-quarters of the world](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/smartphones-72percent-of-people-will-use-only-mobile-for-internet-by-2025.html) will have access to a smartphone by 2025. It's crazy to think people in the world have access to a smartphone but not to a bank account. People who were previously unable to access financial services will hopefully be able to do so using Libra and their smartphone. Users in financially unstable countries like Venezuela, can hopefully hold confidence in a stable currency like Libra. Just as how the internet brought access to information to all, Libra has the chance to bring financial inclusivity to the masses.

It's funny because a bunch of cryptocurrencies have launched with the same 'banking the unbanked' vision. But Facebook, with its vast network and resources, actually has a legitimate shot at doing so.

### Libra is good for Bitcoin!

Many Bitcoin critics believe the introduction of Libra spells the end for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was supposed to be the 'global currency'. But then people found out that it's way too slow for processing transactions and lacks price stability. It's a terrible form of money and will probably die right? Wrong. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

The Bitcoin narrative has changed throughout the years. Now, Bitcoin is seen as digital gold. Just as how people value gold, art, and fancy old cars, people value Bitcoin. As an investment, Bitcoin has shown [limited correlation](https://www.ccn.com/analyst-bitcoins-evolving-into-the-stock-market-hedge-investors-crave/) to other financial sectors, making it a great hedging instrument for investors. 

### Libra is the new Apple Watch

This might be a stretch comparison, but in a way Libra could be like the Apple Watch. I can't remember where, but I read an article on how the Swiss watch industry is currently going through a rejuvenation period. Most analysts thought that the Apple Watch was going to kill off the Swiss watch industry. This was true, until recently a switch in behavior occurred. Overall, more and more people were buying watches mainly because of the Apple Watch. These people started with the Apple Watch, realized they loved having a nice watch, and changed to a luxury Swiss watch. 

Apple Watch → Luxury Swiss Watch could be analogous to Libra → Bitcoin. More and more people exposed to cryptocurrencies like Libra may find value in bitcoin as well.


## Risks to Libra

The main risk to Libra is definitely the regulatory concerns around it. I can see Libra getting severely restrained or even squashed by lawmakers. I don't know much about regulatory policies around money, but complex laws exist, including a nightmare tax law [Facebook will have to deal with](https://www.ft.com/content/bdf46cfc-99aa-11e9-8cfb-30c211dcd229?dlbk&te=1&nl=dealbook&emc=edit_dk_20190701?campaign_id=4&instance_id=10600&segment_id=14816&user_id=8417e72905b36b7eac2ebdf024addd7b&regi_id=81582820_dk_20190701). The day after the Libra announcement, David Marcus (head of Libra development at FB) was summoned to testify before the Senate Banking Committee this month. It makes sense that lawmakers are raising concerns about this new "internet money." It's way too early to tell how Libra gets regulated, but I will be watching closely what comes out of this month's senate hearing.

Another hurdle to Libra will be with on-boarding users and driving user adoption, especially in developing countries. How do users obtain Libra? Will people in India just take their rupees to a "Libra stand" where a Facebook employee pockets the rupees, does a little math to see how much Libra it's worth, and sends Libra to a Facebook account? I hope not, because I can't imagine this process going very smoothly... Facebook has yet to announce how users will obtain Libra, how they will conform to KYC/AML laws, and how Facebook will convince users to actually use Libra.

## The New Global Currency

I'm really excited for Libra and am optimistic about its future. Amazon has transformed the way we shop, Apple has transformed the cellphone, and Google has transformed the way we access information. Can Facebook transform the way we view money?
