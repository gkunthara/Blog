title: Future SaaS Trends

I'm always looking to improve as an investor and technologist. I try to stay up to date on the latest companies and find them either from TechCrunch, Twitter, or newsletters I subscribe to. So when I land on a company website, I try to learn as much as I can - the company's core product, use cases, and customers. But I find it still pretty tough to find essential information such as the year founded or the number of employees. I typically find this information useful, so I decided to build a chrome extension to help.

If you're interested in using it, well... you can't (just yet). I'm still adding some features to it, but it will be released soon! 

The extension uses [Clearbit's Enrichment API](https://clearbit.com/enrichment). I've been impressed with Clearbit's product suite and can see why companies invest in this type of tech. The product can more than pay for itself as sales teams should be able to find and close more data-driven deals.

I'm glad I took on this little side project, as it got me thinking a lot more about SaaS products. What's their use case? Who are their customers? Are they API driven? The SaaS industry is exciting! And despite their high valuations in the public markets, I think we are still in the early innings of a long game.  Here are 3 thoughts on future SaaS trends:

1. **A Focus on Tech Stacks**

The number of developer technologies continues to grow at a torrid pace. Based on the following graphic, GitHub saw a 35% growth in contributions in the last year alone.

Currently, Clearbit returns some of the products a company uses on its front-end (e.g. Optimizely, Segment, Sentry). This is undoubtedly helpful, but what if you knew the company's entire tech stack? Unlocking this kind of information is incredibly valuable for teams building API first or platform products as sales teams can target businesses whose tech stacks align directly with their products.

2. **Products Selling Themselves**

Something unique Hinge offers is your daily "Most Compatible" match. I have no idea what kind of machine learning, AI, or blockchain technology Hinge might be using for this, but what if a SaaS product worked similarly? What if you were able to search for a business and the product was to say, "This business is 90% likely to buy your product." 

As evident from Hinge, we are slowly marching towards this future. I wouldn't be surprised if companies built this type of tool internally for their sales teams. However, it makes logical sense for a company like Clearbit, which specializes in sales data intelligence, to build a generalized form of this.  

3. **Rise in usage-based Billing** - I'm taking this directly from Plaid CEO Zach Perret:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Platform (usage-based billing) is the new SaaS (licensed subscriptions)</p>&mdash; Zachary Perret (@zachperret) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachperret/status/1194504146134552578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2019</a></blockquote>

As a customer, I should only have to pay for what I use, and shouldn't have to commit to pricey monthly or annual subscriptions.

In my case, I was interested in leveraging Clearbit's Prospector API; however, I was deterred when I found out it cost $18K a year. Now if Clearbit offered this API with usage-based billing, then it would become feasible for me to commit and a win-win for both sides. The consumer would get access to the API and pay for only what he/she used. What if my product takes off and I end up paying $25K a year to Clearbit for my usage? Clearbit wins by gaining another significant paying customer onto their platform.

I'm looking forward to seeing if these trends proliferate among SaaS products. As for my app, stay tuned for its release - I can assure you it will hit on some of these ideas.
